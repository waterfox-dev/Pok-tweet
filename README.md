# Poketweet

### IMPORTANT  :

The code is freely accessible and modifiable, however, it is forbidden to use it to operate another twitter bot.
Pushes and pulls are allowed and can be keys to important development, therefore any updates that may be useful are encouraged.
Bot translation is also allowed and is an important part of udpate, these are greatly appreciated. 

###  WARNING : 
It is normal that this code does not work on your machine, indeed the information concerning the connection to the twitter API and the `.venv` are not push.
You must take the necessary steps yourself to obtain the access tokens and create a json file as follows: 
```json
{
    "api_key": "XXX",
    "api_secret_key": "XXX",
    "bearer_token": "XXX",
    "access_token": "XXX",
    "access_token_secret": "XXX"
}
```
Python versions before 3.4 are deprecated for this project.
